    "# Label Encoding is used when the categorical variable is ordinal in nature. For example, if we have a variable called “education” with categories “High School”, “Bachelors”, “Masters”, and “PhD”, we can assign them numerical values 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. This is because there is an inherent order to the categories.\n",

However, there is no inherent order to the categories.\n",
