    "# Bagging, also known as bootstrap aggregation, is a technique used in machine learning to reduce variance and prevent overfitting,\n",
    "# especially in models that have high variance like decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bootstrap Sampling: Bagging starts with creating multiple subsets of the original training data using bootstrap sampling. \n",
    "# In this process, data points are picked at random with replacement, meaning that some samples may appear multiple times in the new subset,\n",
    "# while others may be omitted1. This step ensures that the base models are trained on diverse subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Base Model Training: After the bootstrap sampling, each base model is independently trained using a specific learning algorithm on a \n",
    "# different bootstrapped subset of data. These models are typically called “Weak learners” because they may not be highly accurate on their own.\n",
    "# To make the model computationally efficient and less time-consuming, the base models can be trained in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Aggregation: Once all the base models are trained, they are used to make predictions on unseen data i.e., the subset of data on which that \n",
    "# base model is not trained. In the case of classification, the final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of \n",
    "# all base models, using majority voting. In the case of regression, the final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all base models.\n",
    "\n",
    "# By combining multiple models, bagging introduces diversity into the training process and helps reduce the model’s variance.\n",
    "# This makes the model more robust and less likely to overfit the data."

    "# Diversity: Using different types of base learners can introduce diversity into the ensemble, which can help improve the overall performance.\n",

    "# This means that while the ensemble model might perform well, it can be hard to understand why it’s making the predictions it is, \n",
    "# especially when you’re using many different types of base learners.\n",

    "# Bias: If the base learner is too simple (e.g., a linear model), it may have high bias and low variance.\n",

    "# Bagging can help reduce this variance by smoothing over the learners’ decision boundaries.\n",
