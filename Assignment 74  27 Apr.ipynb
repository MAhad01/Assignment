    "# There are several types of clustering algorithms, each with its own approach and underlying assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Distribution-based methods**: These methods fit the data on the probability that it may belong to the same distribution. The grouping done may be normal or Gaussian. This model works well on synthetic data and diversely sized clusters¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Centroid-based methods**: These are iterative clustering algorithms in which the clusters are formed by the closeness of data points to the centroid of clusters. Here, the cluster center i.e., centroid is formed such that the distance of data points is minimum with the center¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Connectivity-based methods**: The core idea of the connectivity-based model is similar to Centroid-based model which is basically defining clusters on the basis of the closeness of data points¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Density Models**: In this clustering model, there will be searching of data space for areas of the varied density of data points in the data space. It isolates various density regions based on different densities present in the data space¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Subspace clustering**: Subspace clustering is an unsupervised learning problem that aims at grouping data points into multiple clusters so that data points at a single cluster lie approximately on a low-dimensional linear subspace¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. **Fuzzy Clustering**: In fuzzy clustering, each point has probabilities of belonging to all clusters, which is more flexible than hard assignment of points to clusters³.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. **Constraint-based (Supervised Clustering)**: In this type of clustering, the algorithm takes into account prior knowledge about the data points that we want to cluster³.\n",

    "# **K-means clustering** is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups an unlabeled dataset into different clusters¹. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Initialization**: We start by selecting 'k' points randomly. These points are called means or cluster centroids¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Assignment**: Each item in the dataset is categorized to its closest mean. The closeness is determined by calculating the Euclidean distance between the item and each of the means¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Update**: The coordinates of the mean are updated. The new coordinates are the averages of the items categorized in that cluster so far¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Iteration**: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated for a given number of iterations. At the end of these iterations, we have our clusters¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The objective of K-means clustering is to divide the dataset into a number of groups so that the data points within each group are more comparable to one another and different from the data points within the other groups¹. It's important to note that the value of 'k' (i.e., the number of clusters) needs to be predetermined².\n",
