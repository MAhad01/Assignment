    "# **Q1. What are Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors? How are they related to the Eigen-Decomposition approach?**\n",
    "# Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental concepts in linear algebra with wide-ranging applications. For a square matrix `A`, an eigenvector is a non-zero vector `v` that satisfies the equation `Av = λv`, where `λ` is a scalar known as the eigenvalue¹⁷. In other words, when matrix `A` acts on its eigenvector, the vector is merely scaled by the factor `λ`, without any change in its direction²¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Eigen-Decomposition approach involves expressing a given square matrix as a product of three matrices: `A = PDP^-1`, where `P` is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of `A`, `D` is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the eigenvalues of `A`, and `P^-1` is the inverse of `P`⁹. This decomposition provides valuable insights into the structure of the matrix `A`³.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Q2. What is eigen decomposition and what is its significance in linear algebra?**\n",
    "# Eigen decomposition is a method of factorizing a matrix into its canonical form. It is particularly useful for understanding the properties of a matrix and simplifying complex matrix operations⁹. In the context of linear algebra, eigen decomposition plays a crucial role in various algorithms and methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is a popular technique for dimensionality reduction³⁷.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Q3. What are the conditions that must be satisfied for a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach?**\n",
    "# A square matrix is diagonalizable if and only if it has a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors[^10^]. This means that the matrix must have as many distinct eigenvectors as its dimension. The determinant of the matrix subtracted by `λI` (where `I` is the identity matrix and `λ` is the eigenvalue) must be zero¹⁹. This condition ensures that there exists a non-trivial solution for the eigenvectors[^10^].\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Q4. What is the significance of the spectral theorem in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach?**\n",
    "# The spectral theorem provides a powerful tool for understanding linear transformations. It states that a linear operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space is diagonalizable if and only if it is self-adjoint¹⁴. This means that for such operators, there exists an orthonormal basis consisting of eigenvectors of the operator. The spectral theorem is closely related to the diagonalizability of a matrix, as it provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for a matrix to be diagonalizable¹⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Q5. How do you find the eigenvalues of a matrix and what do they represent?**\n",
    "# To find the eigenvalues of a matrix, you solve the characteristic equation, which is given by `det(A - λI) = 0`, where `A` is the matrix, `λ` is a scalar (the eigenvalue), `I` is the identity matrix, and `det` denotes the determinant¹⁸. The solutions to this equation are the eigenvalues of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Eigenvalues represent the scaling factor by which a vector is transformed when a linear transformation is applied⁴. They provide key insights into the matrix's properties, such as its determinant and trace¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Q6. What are eigenvectors and how are they related to eigenvalues?**\n",
    "# Eigenvectors are vectors that only get scaled (and possibly reversed in direction) when a linear transformation is applied²¹. They are related to eigenvalues in that the eigenvalue is the factor by which the corresponding eigenvector is scaled during the transformation⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Q7. Can you explain the geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?**\n",
    "# Geometrically, a transformation matrix rotates, stretches, or shears the vectors it acts upon. The eigenvectors for a linear transformation matrix are the set of vectors that are only stretched, with no rotation or shear. The eigenvalue is the factor by which an eigenvector is stretched. If the eigenvalue is negative, the direction is reversed²¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Q8. What are some real-world applications of eigen decomposition?**\n",
    "# Eigen decomposition has numerous real-world applications, including:\n",
    "# 1. Image compression using singular value decomposition[^30^].\n",
    "# 2. Deriving Special Relativity[^30^].\n",
    "# 3. Spectral Clustering[^30^].\n",
    "# 4. Dimensionality Reduction/PCA[^30^].\n",
    "# 5. The Google Page Rank algorithm[^30^].\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Q9. Can a matrix have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?**\n",
    "# Yes, a matrix can have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. In fact, a matrix can have multiple eigenvectors associated with a single eigenvalue, as long as these eigenvectors are linearly independent³⁴. Also, a matrix can have multiple distinct eigenvalues, each with its own set of associated eigenvectors³³.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Q10. In what ways is the Eigen-Decomposition approach useful in data analysis and machine learning?**\n",
    "# Eigen decomposition is a powerful tool in data analysis and machine learning, with applications in:\n",
    "# 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): This technique uses eigen decomposition to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space, while preserving as much of the data's variation as possible³⁷.\n",
    "# 2. Spectral Clustering: This method uses the eigenvalues of a similarity matrix to reduce the dimensionality of the data before applying a clustering algorithm[^30^].\n",
    "# 3. Google's PageRank Algorithm: This algorithm, which ranks web pages in search engine results, uses eigen decomposition to calculate the importance of each page[^30^].\n",
