    "# Q1. Explain the concept of homogeneity and completeness in clustering evaluation. How are they\n",
    "# calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Homogeneity and completeness are two clustering evaluation metrics that measure how well the clusters align with the true class labels of the data points. They are based on the concept of entropy, which is a measure of uncertainty or randomness in a distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Homogeneity measures how pure each cluster is, i.e., how much each cluster contains only data points from a single class. A clustering result is perfectly homogeneous if all clusters contain only data points from a single class. Homogeneity is calculated as the normalized mutual information between the cluster labels and the class labels, i.e., the ratio of the mutual information and the average entropy of the cluster labels and the class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Completeness measures how well each class is represented by a cluster, i.e., how much each class is assigned to a single cluster. A clustering result is perfectly complete if all data points from a single class are assigned to the same cluster. Completeness is calculated as the normalized mutual information between the class labels and the cluster labels, i.e., the ratio of the mutual information and the average entropy of the class labels and the cluster labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. What is the V-measure in clustering evaluation? How is it related to homogeneity and completeness?\n",
    "\n",
    "# The V-measure is a clustering evaluation metric that combines homogeneity and completeness into a single score. It is based on the concept of harmonic mean, which is a measure of the average of two rates. The V-measure is calculated as the harmonic mean of homogeneity and completeness, i.e., the ratio of the product of homogeneity and completeness and the sum of homogeneity and completeness. The V-measure ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates poor clustering and 1 indicates perfect clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The V-measure is related to homogeneity and completeness by the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "# V-measure = 2 * (homogeneity * completeness) / (homogeneity + completeness)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. How is the Silhouette Coefficient used to evaluate the quality of a clustering result? What is the range\n",
    "# of its values?\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Silhouette Coefficient is a clustering evaluation metric that measures how well a data point fits in its assigned cluster compared to other clusters. It is based on the concept of cohesion and separation, which are measures of the within-cluster and between-cluster distances, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Silhouette Coefficient for a data point is calculated as the difference between the average distance to the data points in the same cluster (cohesion) and the average distance to the data points in the nearest cluster (separation), divided by the maximum of the two distances. The Silhouette Coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates that the data point is closer to another cluster than its own cluster, 0 indicates that the data point is on or very close to the decision boundary between two clusters, and 1 indicates that the data point is well separated from other clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Silhouette Coefficient for a clustering result is calculated as the average of the Silhouette Coefficients of all data points. A high Silhouette Coefficient indicates a well-separated and compact clustering.\n",
