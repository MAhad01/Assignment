    "# The \"curse of dimensionality\" is a common problem in machine learning, where the performance of the model deteriorates as the number of features (or dimensions) increases¹². This is because the complexity of the model increases with the number of features, and it becomes more difficult to find a good solution¹. In addition, high-dimensional data can also lead to overfitting, where the model fits the training data too closely and does not generalize well to new data¹.\n",

In other words, it is a process of transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space that still preserves the essence of the original data¹. This can help to mitigate the problems caused by the curse of dimensionality by reducing the complexity of the model and improving its generalization performance¹.\n",
