    "# This server can be shared by multiple websites or dedicated to a single website. Traditional web hosting solutions include Shared Hosting, VPS Hosting, and Dedicated Hosting .\n",

    "# Cloud hosting is more flexible than traditional web hosting as it allows users to scale their resources up or down based on their website’s traffic demands. \n",
    "# Cloud hosting is also more cost-effective than traditional web hosting as users only pay for the resources they use.\n",

    "# Trust: You should like the company and its principles. Check the provider’s reputation and see who its partners are .\n",
